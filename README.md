## Main functionnalities
- [] Organize the code and create a Makefile.
- [] Implement a small linear algebra library.
- [] Implement basic 1D Finite Volumes schemes.
- [] Create test cases for verification.
- [] Create experimental data files for validation.
- [] Document the code (using Doxygen).

## Additional functionnalities
- [] 2D model.
- [] Implement more robust Finite Volumes schemes.
- [] Parallelize the code.
