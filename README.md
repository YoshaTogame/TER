# TER

C++ solver for the 1D Saint-Venant equations with topography and without friction using the Finite Volumes Method. 

Work in progress...

The code will be validated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data.

## Credits

All developpers are students at ENSEIRB-MATMECA, a french engineering school located in Talence.

## Main functionnalities to implement
- [ ] Organize the code and create a Makefile.
- [ ] Implement a small linear algebra library.
- [ ] Implement basic 1D Finite Volumes schemes.
- [ ] Create test cases for verification.
- [x] Create experimental data files for validation.
- [ ] Document the code (using Doxygen).

## Additional functionnalities
- [ ] 2D model.
- [ ] Implement more robust Finite Volumes schemes.
- [ ] Parallelize the code.
